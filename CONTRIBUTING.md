# Contributing
This is one of the first Vite plugins I do, feel free to open issues and PR. 
The important thing is that everything is explained through the comment and correlated issue.

## Steps
- Open Issue: The first step is to open an issue and write the problem, or the feature that you want the project implement.
- Open a branch from develop: The name of the branch must be feature/[number of issue]
- Open a Pull Request: After made your changes open a PR from your working branch to 'develop'
